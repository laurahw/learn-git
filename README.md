##What is git?
If you’re reading this, then obviously you’ve heard of Git, and obviously GitHub. The two are not the same thing. Git is a version control system, created by Linus Torvalds (also of Linux fame); GitHub is a website that acts as a hosting service for version control that uses git - usually for software code, but not exclusively.
